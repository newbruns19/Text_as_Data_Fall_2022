Hello and welcome to the course blog for Text-as-Data (DACSS 697D). In this course, students learn the fundamentals of text-as-data research, with an introduction to the field and broader theoretical considerations followed by an exploration of a host of different methodological approaches and applications using text-as-data. The focus is on exploration, with students — motivated by central research questions — exploring the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of different approaches.
